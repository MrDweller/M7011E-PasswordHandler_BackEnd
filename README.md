# M7011E-PasswordHandler_BackEnd

A secure password handler, that can store your passwords in a sql database. All passwords will be encrypted and to access them a master password will be used.

This is a schoolproject in the course 'M7011E - Design of Dynamic Web Systems' where the task was to build a dynamic web system. 

This system consists of a front-end built with [React JS](https://reactjs.org/) which can be found [here](https://github.com/MrDweller/M7011E-PasswordHandler_FrontEnd) and two separate back-ends developed with the [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

The back-ends are included on this repository as separate branches as [master-django](https://github.com/MrDweller/M7011E-PasswordHandler_BackEnd/tree/master-django) and [master-node](https://github.com/MrDweller/M7011E-PasswordHandler_BackEnd/tree/master-node) where installation and setup can be found on each README.md for the different repositories and their corresponding branches.
